# I know this is weird sending messages by this way. But hear me out!
## I am also a college student from 1st year and I am also interested in tech just like you.
## I have sent some text to you in linkedin but you never replied, so I tried this way.
## Just wanted to make some friends in this way.
## You can ignore this completely if you want. 
## But if you want to reply just tell me more about yourself, what tech stacks you are learning, in which path you want to persue (WEB/APP/others)
